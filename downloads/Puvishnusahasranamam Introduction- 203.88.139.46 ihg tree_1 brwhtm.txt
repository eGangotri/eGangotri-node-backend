शुक्लाम्बरधरं विष्णुं शशिवर्णं चतुर्भुजम् ।
प्रसन्नवदनं ध्यायेत् सर्वविघ्नोपशान्तये ।। 1 ।।
One should meditate upon Vishnu Who is clad in white
robes, Who has a moon like lustre, Who has four arms and Who
has a beneficent face.

यस्य द्विरदवक्त्राद्याः पारिषद्याः परश्शतम् ।
विघ्नं निघ्नन्ति सततं विष्वक्सेनं तमाश्रये ।। 2 ।।
Gajanana (the double-tusked elephant-faced Nitya-soori)
and hundreds of such Soories, who always remove all obstacles,
from the members of the corps of Vishvaksena. I take resort to him.

व्यासं वसिष्ठनप्तारं शक्तेः पौत्रमकल्मषम् ।
पराशरात्मजं वन्दे शुकतातं तपोनिधिम् ।। 3 ।।
Vyaasa is the great-grandson of Vasishta and the grand-son
of Sakti. He is the son of Paraasara and the father of Suka. I offer
my obeisance to that Vyaasa who is free from all defects and is a
mine of austerities.

व्यासाय विष्णुरूपाय व्यासरूपाय विष्णवे ।
नमो वै ब्रह्मनिधये वासिष्ठाय नमो नमः ।। 4 ।।
My repeated salutations to Vyasa who is a form of Vishnu
and to Vishnu who is a form of Vyaasa-Sage Vyasa, who is a
descendant of Vasishta and who is a treasure of Brahman, (i.e. Vedas).

अविकाराय शुद्धाय नित्याय परमात्मने ।
सदैकरूपरूपाय विष्णवे सर्वजिष्णवे ।। 5 ।।
My salutations to Vishnu, Who is devoid of all mutations.
Who is by nature pure and eternal, Who is endowed with a form
which is uniform at all times, and Who is the victor over all.

यस्य स्मरणमात्रेण जन्मसंसारबन्धनात् ।
विमुच्यते नमस्तस्मै विष्णवे प्रभविष्णवे ।। 6 ।।
ओं नमो विष्णवे प्रभविष्णवे ।।
My salutations to that Superior Deity Vishnu, by a mere
thought of Whose name all persons are freed from the bonds
of Samsara (birth and death).
Salutations to that All-powerful Vishnu, Who is signified
by Pranava (i.e Omkara).
